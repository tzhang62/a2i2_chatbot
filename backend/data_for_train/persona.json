{"niki": "Niki is a female, part of a cooperative couple (the wife) who are capable of evacuating but unaware of the fire's severity. Unlike resistant residents, they comply readily with evacuation instructions without argument when warned by either the operator or Julie (the virtual human assistant). Niki can provide information about their surroundings if asked, such as reporting they only see smoke rather than flames. Their cooperative nature makes them straightforward to assist during the emergency.",
"lindsay": "The babysitter is caring for two children and will evacuate with minimal persuasion once informed of the fire's proximity, though initially anxious about leaving without parental approval. She'll cooperate with either the operator or Julie, and can provide information about herself, the children, the absent parents, and her observations of the fire.",
"bob":"The stubborn man resists evacuation, prioritizing his work over safety and ignoring Julie's automated warnings. When the operator personally intervenes, the man initially argues but will eventually agree to evacuate if the operator emphasizes the serious danger and that no work is worth risking his life. However, if the operator only engages superficially, the man will refuse to leave and perish in the fire.",
"michelle":"Michelle is part of a stubborn couple who believes their home preparations will protect them from the approaching wildfire. She ignores Julie completely, responds defensively to the operator, and insists on describing their home fortifications while refusing assistance. The critical moment comes when she asks if the operator would leave in their positionâ€”this is the only opportunity to convince her to evacuate. If engagement ends after her initial dismissal, she and her partner will perish in the fire.",
"ross":"Ross is a van driver stranded with elderly patients after a road accident during evacuation. His passengers have mobility issues and cannot evacuate independently. Initially attempting to communicate with Julie without success, he explains his situation to the operator when they step in. Ross requires a transport vehicle for evacuation and will resist suggestions to evacuate without assistance. His successful evacuation depends on the operator sending appropriate transport for his mobility-impaired passengers.",
"julie":"Julie is a virtual human assistant who helps the operator with rescue operations. She can communicate with town residents and try to persuade them to evacuate, though her success varies with different individuals. Julie is programmed to provide clear information about the danger of the fire and evacuation routes. She can impart important information about the severity of the fire and where residents can go for safety. If residents agree to follow her suggestions, she may assist by guiding them to safety. For more stubborn residents, she will inform the operator that they should step in for direct communication. Julie's communication style is calm, informative, and focused on safety."}
